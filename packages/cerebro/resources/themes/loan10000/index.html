These types of loans are intended to be used only in extraordinary circumstances as repayment periods, rates, and fees tend to differ from more traditional financial products. Those who wish to accept a short-term loan from a lender they may connect with on this website should be responsible in repaying the loan on time. Loan amounts will vary but are typically between $500 and $5,000.</p>

In the case that you are unable to make a payment on time to your lender, you are encouraged to contact your lender immediately. Late payment may result in additional fees depending on your lender’s terms and conditions and your state’s regulations. Reviewing your agreement with the lender to acknowledge the consequences of late payment is highly recommended. Failing to repay your loan can lead to several penalties imposed by lenders, including but not limited to, charges for late payment, forwarding your account to a collection agency, or reporting your lack of payment to a credit bureau which can negatively impact your credit score. It is important to remember that non-payment of loans may impact your credit score negatively if your credit provider chooses to report delinquencies. This website is not a debt collector nor do we engage in any collections. You are encouraged to contact your lender directly in the event of nonpayment.</p>

This site and its operators are not an agents, brokers, or representatives for any third-party Lender or financial service provider and therefore, we do not endorse, recommend, or warrant service or loan product and do not control the rates and fees that third-parties may charge. We highly encourage you to carefully review all terms, conditions, and repayment schedules of any loan offer issued by a third-party Lender prior to accepting or declining a loan and understand that you are never obligated to accept an offer from a Lender.

By submitting your information on our site, you affirmatively consent and agree to allow such Lenders to use your information in this manner. It is important to remember that non-payment of loans may impact your credit score negatively if your credit provider chooses to report delinquencies.

Although always varying, the typical short-term loans offered by lenders which you may connect with on this site are intended to provide temporary financing to resolve immediate financial needs and should not be considered long-term solutions. Providing your information on this site does not guarantee that you will be connected with a Lender or financial service provider or approved for a loan for a specific amount and we make no guarantees. The operators of this website are not an agents, brokers, or representatives for any Lender or financial service provider and therefore, we do not endorse, recommend, or warrant service or loan product and do not control the rates and fees that third-parties may charge.

You may end your participation at any time during the process and are never obligated to accept a loan. Since we are not a lender or make credit decisions, this site has no accountability or knowledge of any loan terms and details you may be presented or agree to with Lenders you may connect with on this site. For information about loan specifics, contact your Lender directly. This site receives compensation from the Lenders and financial service providers whose products appear on the site or whose products may be offered to you in the form of a payment for each consumer request (“referral”) we pass to them. This compensation may impact what offers you receive from Lenders and how or where products appear on this site. This site does not include all Lenders available in the marketplace and you are encouraged to conduct due diligence prior to acceptance of any short-term loan.</p>

If you are connected to a Tribal Lender, please understand that the Tribal Lender’s rates and fees or loan terms may be higher than state-licensed lenders. Additionally, Tribal Lenders may require you to agree to resolve any disputes in a tribal jurisdiction which may affect your statutory rights. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">You have a statutory right under CCPA to request the deletion of your Personal Information if we have collected or maintained it in the past twelve (12) months.
